# CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis – House Price Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main
characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual
methods. It’s where the researcher takes a bird’s eye view of the data and tries to make
some sense of it. It’s often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any formal
statistical techniques are applied.

# CA02: Building a Spam Detector using Naive Bayes Algorithm
	
Assignment Description: In this exercise we shall train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam
or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category.
Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category
of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know.

Instructions: The data folders are in a Zip file at BrightSpace CA02 assignment folder. The assignment
instruction document and the provided .ipynb file is also at BrightSpace.
What you are supposed to do:

1. Read the code and understand the logic of every line of the code

2. Complete the code (there are missing areas of the code and it is mentioned in the
		commented cells), such that the code runs properly and produces the exact same
		result as displayed at the end of the notebook.

3. Comment the code thoroughly using “markdown” texts and comment lines so that
		the logic of the code is easily understandable. It’s your job to explain clearly your
		understanding of the process at every step

# CA03 – Decision Tree Algorithm

1. Data Source and Contents

2. Data Quality Analysis (DQA)

3. Build Decision Tree Classifier Models
Definition: Given a data of attributes together with its classes, a decision tree produces a
sequence of rules that can be used to classify the data.
Advantages: Decision Tree is simple to understand and visualise, requires little data
preparation, and can handle both numerical and categorical data.
Disadvantages: Decision tree can create complex trees that do not generalize well, and
decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a
completely different tree being generated.

4. Evaluate Decision Tree Performance
Calculate and display the following. Do all of these inside your Notebook.
• Confusion Matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN ... etc.)
• Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

5. Tune Decision Tree Performance
Try varying FOUR of the hyperparameters manually, as per the following table, and train /
score your model for each set of these hyperparameters. Record your Tree’s performance
with respect to each of these sets of hyperparameters in the Model Performance section of
the following table.

6. Visualize Your Best Decision Tree using GraphViz

7. Conclusion
Explain your observations from the above performance tuning effort.
Q.4 How long was your total run time to train the best model?
Q.5 Did you find the BEST TREE?
Q.6 Write your observations from the visualization of the best tree
Q.7 Will this Tree “overfit”? (Hint: Is this tree “fully grown”

8. Prediction using your “trained” Decision Tree Model

9. Deliverables
Your assignment outputs will have the following components:
(1) Fully functional Notebook, Data, Readme file in a single folder at GitHub (this is for
sharing with your peer for peer review)
(2) Upload your fully executed notebook at BrightSpace
(3) All questions should be answered with the corresponding Question Numbers in
Marked-down Cells in the Notebook.
