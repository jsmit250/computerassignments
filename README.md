# CA01: Exploratory Data Analysis – House Price Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main
characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual
methods. It’s where the researcher takes a bird’s eye view of the data and tries to make
some sense of it. It’s often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any formal
statistical techniques are applied.

# CA02: Building a Spam Detector using Naive Bayes Algorithm
	
Assignment Description: In this exercise we shall train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam
or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category.
Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category
of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know.

Instructions: The data folders are in a Zip file at BrightSpace CA02 assignment folder. The assignment
instruction document and the provided .ipynb file is also at BrightSpace.
What you are supposed to do:

1. Read the code and understand the logic of every line of the code

2. Complete the code (there are missing areas of the code and it is mentioned in the
		commented cells), such that the code runs properly and produces the exact same
		result as displayed at the end of the notebook.

3. Comment the code thoroughly using “markdown” texts and comment lines so that
		the logic of the code is easily understandable. It’s your job to explain clearly your
		understanding of the process at every step
